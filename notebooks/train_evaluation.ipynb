In case of conflict of polarity between the sentence and the emoji, aim to understand if the text is ironic.\n","\n","## Useful Links\n","- [Notion](https://www.notion.so/Research-Methodology-Project-Planning-d4631470aa3a41a5a31614b38937ccc9): Documents of the research including papers, datasets and implementations.\n","- [Selected dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment): The Twitter US Airline Sentiment dataset stored how travelers in February 2015 expressed their feelings of each major U.S.airline on Twitter.
